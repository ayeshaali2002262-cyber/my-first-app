## Understanding the Output

**Main Points** (with blue bullet)
```
• This is a main point from the slide
```

**Headings** (bold text)
```
**Section Title or Main Topic**
```

**Sub-points** (indented)
```
  • This is a supporting detail
  • This is another sub-point
```

### Example Output

```
**Project Management Best Practices**
